# Vendored Meraki OpenAPI spec

`meraki-openapi.json.gz` is the gzipped, vendored baseline of the Cisco Meraki Dashboard
API OpenAPI spec. The `api-drift` CI lane uses it as the comparison baseline for detecting
upstream API drift on the operations this integration consumes.

- **Source:** <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meraki/openapi/master/openapi/spec3.json>
- **Vendored version (`info.version`):** 1.71.0
- **Do not hand-edit.** Refresh with `make refresh-meraki-spec`, then update the version above.

## How drift detection uses this

1. The `apidrift` tool (`tools/apidrift/`) AST-scans `custom_components/meraki_dashboard/`
   for the Meraki SDK operations this integration actually consumes
   (call form: `dashboard.<controller>.<method>(...)`).
2. It reduces both this baseline and the freshly-fetched live spec to that consumed surface.
3. `oasdiff` compares the two reduced specs for breaking changes.

## Acknowledging drift

When the daily `api-drift` job flags a breaking change, either:

1. **Fix + re-vendor** — update the affected code, run `make refresh-meraki-spec`,
   and update the version note above, **or**
2. **Defer** — add a line to `oasdiff-ignore.txt` describing the change to suppress it until
   you're ready to address it.
